### This is my register page. The user registers and then login in. 
When the user saves the information, it saves it in our database.

I used md5 in this project. And md5 is : 
### The Message-Digest Algorithm 5 (MD5) was designed to be used as a cryptographic hash function.
This MD5 hash generator is useful for encoding passwords, credit cards numbers and other sensitive date into MySQL.
MD5 hashes are also used to ensure the data integrity of files. Because the MD5 hash algorithm always produces the same output for the same given input, users can compare a hash of the source file with a newly created hash of the destination file to check that it is intact and unmodified.

An MD5 hash is NOT encryption. It is simply a fingerprint of the given input. However, it is a one-way transaction and as such it is almost impossible to reverse engineer an MD5 hash to retrieve the original string.
